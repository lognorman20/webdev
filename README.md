# webdev

this is a repo for me to practice my web dev skills. i am starting off with the odin project and grinding out
the course readings as well as the projects they have listed. i am aiming to speed run the first course by the end of
the day in order for me to be able to move on to blockchain stuff later this weekend. i mainly just need to learn
how to do javascript stuff so that i know how to use apis and build a cool frontend for my dapps. nonetheless, i am
still going to learn as much as i can and enjoy the process.

best regards,
